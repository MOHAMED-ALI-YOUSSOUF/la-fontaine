        "content":"Afar People Association successfully delivered the first round of food aid to individuals displaced from their own lands in the Afar region of Ethiopia, especially in the 2nd Region Villages such as Abala, Erebti, Barahle, Konnaba, Dallol, Magale, and more than 20 rural districts. In the ongoing conflict in Ethiopia, Afar people, particularly pastoralists, were forced out of their homes, and thousands of people have lost their lives. The wounded, women, and children fleeing the conflict are dying due to a lack of water and food. This is a very sad situation, but the rescued people actually have urgent demands for food, medicine, and other basic needs, as those who have already been rescued are living in shelters in neighboring districts. Therefore, we would like to express our gratitude on behalf of our association and the Afar people to the Turkish public and organizations that immediately respond to our humanitarian aid calls and contribute. Our association also works closely with other humanitarian organizations, NGOs, and associations and invites everyone willing to join and contribute to the well-being of the displaced Afar people. We thank you in advance. We want to thank everyone who has contributed, and no amount of thanks is enough."
